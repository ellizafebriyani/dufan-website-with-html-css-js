			<br><center><a class="btn">History of Dufan and Monkeys</a></center></br>
			<p><center> &nbsp; The Dufan project was launched in the early 1980s when at that time Ancol was still under the leadership of Mr. Handogo Soekarno who had as head of the promotion division of Taman Impian Jaya Ancol. At that time, Handogo gave a mandate to Benny Benhardi to make illustrations using Birds Eye View. This work was carried out at the Balai Samudra Architecture office under the direction of Mr. Sutisna and senior architect Budi Priambodo and several draftsmen. Dunia Fantasi has several mascots, one of which is a proboscis monkey named Dufan (short for Dunia Fantasi).</center></p>
			<br><p><center> &nbsp; The choice of ape as a character is to remind us that Ancol used to be a monkey area. Meanwhile, the selection of the proboscis monkey is solely to introduce endangered species that are now protected. At first, the cartoon form of the proboscis monkey was visualized by Matari Advertising who participated in the initial Dunia Fantasi communication program because at that time, Agustinus Teddy Darmanto, as chairman and person in charge of BenDufa (World Fantasy Workshop) was very busy in the final completion stage. Therefore, the visualization is given to Matari Advertising. However, after Dunia Fantasi opened to the public, BenDufa's team took over the visualization of Dufan's character and created the logo and the characters of Dunia Fantasi.</p></center></br>
			<br><center><a class="btn">Fantasy World Area (Dufan)</a></center></br>
			<br><p><center> &nbsp; Dufan is divided into several areas with their own themes and characteristics of each region. The distribution of this area is intended to awaken the imagination of visitors who are expected to be able to feel the sensation of Fantasy Around the World and Dufan's Modern Era starting from Jakarta, America, Doll Palace, Indonesia, Europe, Asia, Saga, Adventure, Greece, Indoor Dufan, and Cartoon World.</center></p></br>
			<br><p><center> &nbsp; Apart from rides and shows, Dufan also has a number of restaurants, merchandise shops, and arcade games. Dunia Fantasi's area reaches 21 hectares of the planned development of the 552 hectares integrated entertainment area Taman Impian Jaya Ancol. Ancol offers outdoor amusement rides but also provides rides for games with sophisticated technology to fantasize around the world which consists of 9 areas starting from Indonesia, Jakarta, Europe, Asia, Greece, America, Hikayat, Fantasy Light and Kalila.</center></p></br>
			<br><p><center> &nbsp; As a vehicle for fantasy as the largest physics tourism area in Indonesia, Dunia Fantasi (Dufan), Ancol has added another new area, namely Indoor Dufan. During 2014-2015 it has been equipped with Kontiki, Ice Age, and Hello Kitty rides.
